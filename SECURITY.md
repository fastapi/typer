# Security Policy

Security is very important for Typer and its community. 🔒

Learn more about it below. 👇

We actively provide security fixes for the latest stable release.

You are encouraged to [write tests](https://typer.tiangolo.com/tutorial/testing/) for your application and update your Typer version frequently after ensuring that your tests are passing. This way you will benefit from the latest features, bug fixes, and **security fixes**.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you think you found a vulnerability, and even if you are not sure about it, please report it right away by sending an email to: security@tiangolo.com. Please try to be as explicit as possible, describing all the steps and example code to reproduce the security issue.

I (the author, [@tiangolo](https://twitter.com/tiangolo)) will review it thoroughly and get back to you.

## Public Discussions

Please restrain from publicly discussing a potential security vulnerability. 🙊

It's better to discuss privately and try to find a solution first, to limit the potential impact as much as possible.
