The same way as with a CLI application with a single command, subcommands (or just "commands") can also have their own *CLI arguments*:

```Python hl_lines="7  12"
{!../docs_src/commands/arguments/tutorial001.py!}
```

<div class="termy">

```console
// Check the help for create
$ python main.py create --help

Usage: main.py create [OPTIONS] USERNAME

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.

// Call it with a CLI argument
$ python main.py create Camila

Creating user: Camila

// The same for delete
$ python main.py delete Camila

Deleting user: Camila
```

</div>

!!! tip
    Everything to the *right* of the *command* are *CLI parameters* (*CLI arguments* and *CLI options*) for that command.

!!! note "Technical Details"
    Actually, it's everything to the right of that command, *before any subcommand*.

    It's possible to have groups of *subcommands*, it's like if one *command* also had *subcommands*. And then those *subcommands* could have their own *CLI parameters*, taking their own *CLI parameters*.

    You will see about them later in another section.
