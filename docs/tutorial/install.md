# Install **Typer**

The first step is to install **Typer**.

First, make sure you create your [virtual environment](../virtual-environments.md){.internal-link target=_blank}, activate it, and then install it, for example with:

<div class="termy">

```console
$ pip install typer
---> 100%
Successfully installed typer click shellingham rich
```

</div>

By default, `typer` comes with `rich` and `shellingham`.

```bash
pip install typer
```
