# One File Per Command

When your CLI application grows, you can split it into multiple files and modules. This pattern helps maintain a clean and organized code structure. âœ¨

This tutorial will show you how to use `add_typer` to create sub commands and organize your commands in multiple files.

We will create a simple CLI with the following commands:

- `version`
- `users add NAME`
- `users delete NAME`

## CLI structure

Here is the structure we'll be working with:

```text
mycli/
â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
â”œâ”€â”€ main.py
â”œâ”€â”€ users/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ add.py
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ delete.py
â””â”€â”€ version.py
```

`mycli` will be our <abbr title="a directory with an __init__.py file, it can be imported">package</abbr>, and it will contain the following modules:

- `main.py`: The main <abbr title="a Python file that can be imported">module</abbr> that will import the `version` and `users` modules.
- `version.py`: A <abbr title="a Python file that can be imported">module</abbr> that will contain the `version` command.
- `users/`: A <abbr title="another directory with an __init__.py file, it can also be imported">package</abbr> (inside of our `mycli` package) that will contain the `add` and `delete` commands.

## Implementation

Let's start implementing our CLI! ðŸš€

We'll create the `version` module, the `main` module, and the `users` package.

### Version Module (`version.py`)

Let's start by creating the `version` module. This module will contain the `version` command.

{* docs_src/one_file_per_command/version.py *}

In this file we are creating a new Typer app instance for the `version` command.

This is not required in single-file applications, but in the case of multi-file applications it will allow us to include this command in the main application using `app.add_typer()`.

Let's see that next!

### Main Module (`main.py`)

The main module will be the entry point of the application. It will import the version module and the users module.

/// tip

We'll see how to implement the users module in the next section.

///

{* docs_src/one_file_per_command/main.py hl[8,9] *}

In this module, we import the `version` and `users` modules and add them to the main app using `app.add_typer()`.

For the `users` module, we specify the name as `"users"` to group the commands under the `users` sub-command.

Notice that we didn't add a name for the `version_app` Typer app. Because of this, Typer will add the commands (just one in this case) declared in the `version_app` directly at the top level. So, there will be a top-level `version` sub-command.

But for `users`, we add a name `"users"`, this way those commands will be under the sub-command `users` instead of at the top level. So, there will be a `users add` and `users delete` sub-sub-commands. ðŸ˜…

/// tip

If you want a command to group the included commands in a sub-app, add a name.

If you want to include the commands from a sub-app directly at the top level, don't add a name, or set it to `None`. ðŸ¤“

///

Let's now create the `users` module with the `add` and `delete` commands.

### Users Add Command (`users/add.py`)

{* docs_src/one_file_per_command/users/add.py *}

Like the `version` module, we create a new Typer app instance for the `users/add` command. This allows us to include the `add` command in the users app.

### Users Delete Command (`users/delete.py`)

{* docs_src/one_file_per_command/users/delete.py *}

And once again, we create a new Typer app instance for the `users/delete` command. This allows us to include the `delete` command in the users app.

### Users' app (`users/__init__.py`)

Finally, we need to create an `__init__.py` file in the `users` directory to define the `users` app.

{* docs_src/one_file_per_command/users/__init__.py *}

Similarly to the `version` module, we create a new `Typer` app instance for the `users` module. This allows us to include the `add` and `delete` commands in the users app.

## Running the Application

Now we are ready to run the application! ðŸ˜Ž

To run the application, you can execute it as a Python module:

<div class="termy">

```console
$ python -m mycli.main version

My CLI Version 1.0

$ python -m mycli.main users add Camila

Adding user: Camila
```

</div>

And if you built a package and installed your app, you can then use the `mycli` command:

<div class="termy">

```console
$ mycli version

My CLI Version 1.0

$ mycli users add Camila

Adding user: Camila
```

</div>

## Callbacks

Have in mind that if you include a sub-app with `app.add_typer()` **without a name**, the commands will be added to the top level, so **only the top level callback** (if there's any) will be used, the one declared in the main app.

If you **want to use a callback** for a sub-app, you need to include the sub-app **with a name**, which creates a sub-command grouping the commands in that sub-app. ðŸ¤“

In the example above, if the `users` sub-app had a callback, it would be used. But if the `version` sub-app had a callback, it would not be used, because the `version` sub-app was included without a name.
