## 0.12.1

Now you don't need to install `typer[all]`. When you install `typer` it comes with the default optional dependencies and the `typer` command.

If you don't want the extra optional dependencies (`rich` and `shellingham`), you can install `typer-slim` instead.

You can also install `typer-slim[standard]`, which includes the default optional dependencies, but not the `typer` command.

Now the package `typer-cli` doesn't add anything on top of what `typer` has, it only depends on `typer`, and is there only for backwards compatibility, so that projects that depend on `typer-cli` can get the latest features of the `typer` command while they upgrade their dependencies to require `typer` directly.

### Features

* ✨ Add support for `typer ./someprogram.py utils docs --title`. PR [#782](https://github.com/tiangolo/typer/pull/782) by [@tiangolo](https://github.com/tiangolo).

### Fixes

* 🐛 Fix broken installation when upgrading from `typer <0.12.0` to `typer >=0.12.0`, make `typer` independent of `typer-slim`, include `typer` command in `typer` package. PR [#791](https://github.com/tiangolo/typer/pull/791) by [@tiangolo](https://github.com/tiangolo).

This fixes a problem that would break the `typer` installation directory when upgrading from `typer <0.12.0` to `typer >=0.12.0`, see issue [#790](https://github.com/tiangolo/typer/issues/790).

By installing the latest version (`0.12.1`) it fixes it, for any previous version, even if the installation directory was already broken by the previous upgrade.

### Internal

* 👷 Add cron to run test once a week on monday. PR [#783](https://github.com/tiangolo/typer/pull/783) by [@estebanx64](https://github.com/estebanx64).

## 0.12.0

In version `0.12.0`, the `typer` package depends on `typer-slim[standard]` which includes the default dependencies (instead of `typer[all]`) and `typer-cli` (that provides the `typer` command).

If you don't want the extra optional dependencies (`rich` and `shellingham`), you can install `typer-slim` instead.

You can also install `typer-slim[standard]`, which includes the default optional dependencies, but not the `typer` command.

In version `0.12.0` the `typer-cli` package only provides the `typer` command, but the code is still in the main code, so even without installing `typer-cli`, it can be called with `python -m typer`.

This approach of having `typer` depend on `typer-slim[standard]` instead of including the whole code and dependencies itself caused an issue when upgrading from `typer <0.12.0` to `typer >=0.12.0`, see issue [#790](https://github.com/tiangolo/typer/issues/790). This is fixed in version `0.12.1`.

### Features

* ✨ Add `typer-slim` package without extras, make `typer` include `typer-slim[default]` and integrate Typer CLI (`typer` command) into Typer. PR [#780](https://github.com/tiangolo/typer/pull/780) by [@tiangolo](https://github.com/tiangolo).

### Internal

* 🔧 Temporarily disable social plugin while a MkDocs issue is handled. PR [#779](https://github.com/tiangolo/typer/pull/779) by [@tiangolo](https://github.com/tiangolo).
* 👷 Fix install MkDocs Insiders only when available. PR [#778](https://github.com/tiangolo/typer/pull/778) by [@tiangolo](https://github.com/tiangolo).

### Internal

## 0.6.0

This release adds deep integrations with [Rich](https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). ✨

`rich` is an optional dependency, you can install it directly or it will be included when you install with:

```console
$ pip install "typer[all]"
```

If Rich is available, it will be used to show the content from `--help` options, validation errors, and even errors in your app (exception tracebacks).

There are new options to group commands, *CLI arguments*, and *CLI options*, support for [Rich Console Markup](https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/stable/markup.html), and more! 🎉

### Features

* ✨ Richify, add integrations with Rich everywhere. PR [#419](https://github.com/tiangolo/typer/pull/419) by [@tiangolo](https://github.com/tiangolo).
    * Recommend Rich as the main information displaying tool, new docs: [Printing and Colors](https://typer.tiangolo.com/tutorial/printing/).
    * For most use cases not using Rich, use plain `print()` instead of `typer.echo()` in the docs, to simplify the concepts and avoid confusions. New docs: [Printing and Colors - typer Echo](https://typer.tiangolo.com/tutorial/printing/#typer-echo).
    * Define help panels for *CLI arguments*, new docs: [CLI Arguments with Help - CLI Argument help panels](https://typer.tiangolo.com/tutorial/arguments/help/#cli-argument-help-panels).
    * Define help panels for *CLI options*, new docs: [CLI Options with Help - CLI Options help panels](https://typer.tiangolo.com/tutorial/options/help/#cli-options-help-panels).
    * New docs for deprecating commands: [Commands - Command Help - Deprecate a Command](https://typer.tiangolo.com/tutorial/commands/help/#deprecate-a-command).

## 0.3.0

* Add support for `help` parameter in *CLI arguments*:
    * As `help` in *CLI arguments* is not supported by Click, there are two new internal classes (Click sub-classes) to support it:
        * `typer.core.TyperArgument`
        * `typer.core.TyperCommand`
    * This includes a new auto-generated help text section `Arguments` for *CLI arguments*, showing defaults, required arguments, etc.
    * It's also possible to disable it and keep the previous behavior, not showing automatic help for *CLI arguments* (Click's default) using the `hidden` parameter.
    * Now `show_default` is `True` by default.
    * And now `show_envvar` is `True` by default.
    * So, default values and env vars are shown in the help text by default, without having to manually enable them, for both *CLI arguments* and *CLI options*.
    * New docs:
        * [CLI Arguments Intro](https://typer.tiangolo.com/tutorial/arguments/).
        * [Optional CLI Arguments](https://typer.tiangolo.com/tutorial/arguments/optional/).
        * [CLI Arguments with Default](https://typer.tiangolo.com/tutorial/arguments/default/).

        * [CLI arguments with tuples](https://typer.tiangolo.com/tutorial/multiple-values/arguments-with-multiple-values/#cli-arguments-with-tuples).
    * Lot's of tests for all the new examples in the new docs, keeping coverage at 100%.

* Add docs for calling packages with `python -m some_package` using `__main__.py`: [Building a Package: Support `python -m`](https://typer.tiangolo.com/tutorial/package/#support-python-m-optional). PR [#121](https://github.com/tiangolo/typer/pull/121).
