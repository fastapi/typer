# Repository Management Tasks

These are the tasks that can be performed to manage the Typer repository by [team members](./management.md#team){.internal-link target=_blank}.

/// tip

This section is useful only to a handful of people, team members with permissions to manage the repository. You can probably skip it. üòâ

///

...so, you are a [team member of Typer](./management.md#team){.internal-link target=_blank}? Wow, you are so cool! üòé

You can help with everything on [Help Typer - Get Help](./help-typer.md){.internal-link target=_blank} the same ways as external contributors. But additionally, there are some tasks that only you (as part of the team) can perform.

Here are the general instructions for the tasks you can perform.

Thanks a lot for your help. üôá

## Be Nice

First of all, be nice. üòä

You probably are super nice if you were added to the team, but it's worth mentioning it. ü§ì

### When Things are Difficult

When things are great, everything is easier, so that doesn't need much instructions. But when things are difficult, here are some guidelines.

Try to find the good side. In general, if people are not being unfriendly, try to thank their effort and interest, even if you disagree with the main subject (discussion, PR), just thank them for being interested in the project, or for having dedicated some time to try to do something.

It's difficult to convey emotion in text, use emojis to help. üòÖ

In discussions and PRs, in many cases, people bring their frustration and show it without filter, in many cases exaggerating, complaining, being entitled, etc. That's really not nice, and when it happens, it lowers our priority to solve their problems. But still, try to breath, and be gentle with your answers.

Try to avoid using bitter sarcasm or potentially passive-aggressive comments. If something is wrong, it's better to be direct (try to be gentle) than sarcastic.

Try to be as specific and objective as possible, avoid generalizations.

For conversations that are more difficult, for example to reject a PR, you can ask me (@tiangolo) to handle it directly.

## Edit PR Titles

* Edit the PR title to start with an emoji from <a href="https://gitmoji.dev/" class="external-link" target="_blank">gitmoji</a>.
    * Use the emoji character, not the GitHub code. So, use `üêõ` instead of `:bug:`. This is so that it shows up correctly outside of GitHub, for example in the release notes.
* Start the title with a verb. For example `Add`, `Refactor`, `Fix`, etc. This way the title will say the action that the PR does. Like `Add support for teleporting`, instead of `Teleporting wasn't working, so this PR fixes it`.
* Edit the text of the PR title to start in "imperative", like giving an order. So, instead of `Adding support for teleporting` use `Add support for teleporting`.
* Try to make the title descriptive about what it achieves. If it's a feature, try to describe it, for example `Add support for teleporting` instead of `Create TeleportAdapter class`.
* Do not finish the title with a period (`.`).

Once the PR is merged, a GitHub Action (<a href="https://github.com/tiangolo/latest-changes" class="external-link" target="_blank">latest-changes</a>) will use the PR title to update the latest changes automatically.

So, having a nice PR title will not only look nice in GitHub, but also in the release notes. üìù

## Add Labels to PRs

The same GitHub Action <a href="https://github.com/tiangolo/latest-changes" class="external-link" target="_blank">latest-changes</a> uses one label in the PR to decide the section in the release notes to put this PR in.

Make sure you use a supported label from the <a href="https://github.com/tiangolo/latest-changes#using-labels" class="external-link" target="_blank">latest-changes list of labels</a>:

* `breaking`: Breaking Changes
    * Existing code will break if they update the version without changing their code. This rarely happens, so this label is not frequently used.
* `security`: Security Fixes
    * This is for security fixes, like vulnerabilities. It would almost never be used.
* `feature`: Features
    * New features, adding support for things that didn't exist before.
* `bug`: Fixes
    * Something that was supported didn't work, and this fixes it. There are many PRs that claim to be bug fixes because the user is doing something in an unexpected way that is not supported, but they considered it what should be supported by default. Many of these are actually features or refactors. But in some cases there's an actual bug.
* `refactor`: Refactors
    * This is normally for changes to the internal code that don't change the behavior. Normally it improves maintainability, or enables future features, etc.
* `upgrade`: Upgrades
    * This is for upgrades to direct dependencies from the project, or extra optional dependencies, normally in `pyproject.toml`. So, things that would affect final users, they would end up receiving the upgrade in their code base once they update. But this is not for upgrades to internal dependencies used for development, testing, docs, etc. Those internal dependencies, normally in `requirements.txt` files or GitHub Action versions should be marked as `internal`, not `upgrade`.
* `docs`: Docs
    * Changes in docs. This includes updating the docs, fixing typos. But it doesn't include changes to translations.
    * You can normally quickly detect it by going to the "Files changed" tab in the PR and checking if the updated file(s) starts with `docs/en/docs`. The original version of the docs is always in English, so in `docs/en/docs`.
* `internal`: Internal
    * Use this for changes that only affect how the repo is managed. For example upgrades to internal dependencies, changes in GitHub Actions or scripts, etc.

/// tip

Some tools like Dependabot, will add some labels, like `dependencies`, but have in mind that this label is not used by the `latest-changes` GitHub Action, so it won't be used in the release notes. Please make sure one of the labels above is added.

## Review PRs

If a PR doesn't explain what it does or why, ask for more information.

A PR should have a specific use case that it is solving.

* If the PR is for a feature, it should have docs.
    * Unless it's a feature we want to discourage, like support for a corner case that we don't want users to use.
* The docs should include a source example file, not write Python directly in Markdown.
* If the source example(s) file can have different syntax for Python 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, there should be different versions of the file, and they should be shown in tabs in the docs.
* There should be tests testing the source example.
* Before the PR is applied, the new tests should fail.
* After applying the PR, the new tests should pass.
* Coverage should stay at 100%.
* If you see the PR makes sense, or we discussed it and considered it should be accepted, you can add commits on top of the PR to tweak it, to add docs, tests, format, refactor, remove extra files, etc.
* Feel free to comment in the PR to ask for more information, to suggest changes, etc.
* Once you think the PR is ready, move it in the internal GitHub project for me to review it.

## Dependabot PRs

Dependabot will create PRs to update dependencies for several things, and those PRs all look similar, but some are way more delicate than others.

* If the PR is for a direct dependency, so, Dependabot is modifying `pyproject.toml`, **don't merge it**. üò± Let me check it first. There's a good chance that some additional tweaks or updates are needed.
* If the PR updates one of the internal dependencies, for example it's modifying `requirements.txt` files, or GitHub Action versions, if the tests are passing, the release notes (shown in a summary in the PR) don't show any obvious potential breaking change, you can merge it. üòé

## Mark GitHub Discussions Answers

When a question in GitHub Discussions has been answered, mark the answer by clicking "Mark as answer".

Many of the current Discussion Questions were migrated from old issues. Many have the label `answered`, that means they were answered when they were issues, but now in GitHub Discussions, it's not known what is the actual response from the messages.

You can filter discussions by <a href="https://github.com/fastapi/typer/discussions/categories/questions?discussions_q=category:Questions+is:open+is:unanswered" class="external-link" target="_blank">`Questions` that are `Unanswered`</a>.
