Typer is a library for building <abbr title="command line interface, programs executed from a terminal">CLI</abbr> applications that users will **love using** and developers will **love creating**. Based on Python type hints.

It's also a command line tool to run scripts, automatically converting them to CLI applications.

## `typer-slim`

⚠️ Do not install this package. ⚠️

This package, `typer-slim`, does nothing other than depend on `typer`.

There used to be a slimmed-down version of Typer called `typer-slim`, which didn't include the dependencies `rich` and `shellingham`, nor the `typer` command.

However, since version 0.22.0, we have stopped supporting this, and `typer-slim` now simply installs (all of) Typer.

If you want to disable Rich globally, you can set an environmental variable `TYPER_USE_RICH` to `False` or `0`.

The only reason this package exists is as a migration path for old projects that used to depend on `typer-slim`, so that they can get the latest version of `typer`.

You **should not** install this package.

Install instead:

```bash
pip install typer
```

This package is deprecated and will stop receiving any updates and published versions.
